# Tidal-library-data-transfer-Rewrited
A tiny tool to transfer all your music between 2 Tidal accounts. I'm rewrited my old code to work with new Tidal API by EbbLabs.


I'm Maverick565, i was lost my old Github account, because of lost phone with 2FA. Meantime there was massive changes in Tidal API since latest version of Tidal Library Data Transfer so i decided to make new repo. I made some minor changes, now there is no separated apps for albums, artists, playlists and tracks, now you could choose action in CLI by input corresponding number. You could also transfer everything like before, just choose "5" from list.

1 - Favorite Tracks
2 - Albums
3 - Artists
4 - Playlists (Cloned with custom order)
5 - Everything

## Setup:
1. Download and install my edited tidalapi so that there is no limit for 1000 songs:

```bash
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/EbbLabs/python-tidal.git
```

2. 
```bash
    pip install tqdm

```
3. Run the script as desired.
